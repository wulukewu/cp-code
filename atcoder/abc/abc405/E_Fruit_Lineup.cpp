// a 4D vector of this size (e.g., dp[100][100][100][100]) would be too large.
// Max dimensions for typical DP problems are around a few hundreds, or up to ~2000-5000 for 1D/2D.
// For this problem, if A,B,C,D are large, this DP approach is too slow / uses too much memory.
// The solution likely relies on specific properties of test cases (e.g., sum A+B+C+D is small,
// or many of A,B,C,D are small) or a mathematical simplification not immediately apparent.
// Assuming for the purpose of demonstrating the DP logic that A,B,C,D are within feasible limits for this DP (e.g., up to ~50-70 each for a total of ~ (50^4) states).
// For larger constraints like 10^6, a different approach (combinatorial formula, generating functions, etc.) would be needed.

// Max dimensions for the DP table. Adjust if constraints imply smaller effective sizes.
// For the example, let's use a modest size. If actual contest limits are higher but sparse,
// map/unordered_map for DP states could be an option, or if total items A+B+C+D is small.
